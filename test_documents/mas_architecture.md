# Multi-Agent System (MAS) Architecture Guide

## Overview

The Multi-Agent System (MAS) is a sophisticated architecture that enables multiple specialized AI agents to work together seamlessly. This document provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing MAS using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK).

## Core Architecture Concepts

### 1. Hub-and-Spoke Model

The MAS follows a hub-and-spoke architecture where:
- **Hub (Coordinator)**: A central agent that receives all user requests and routes them to appropriate sub-agents
- **Spokes (Sub-Agents)**: Specialized agents that handle specific domains or tasks

### 2. Agent Communication

Agents communicate through structured message passing:
- All messages go through the coordinator
- Sub-agents return structured responses (dictionaries)
- The coordinator aggregates and presents results to users

## Implementation Details

### Coordinator Agent

The coordinator is implemented using `LlmAgent` from Google ADK:

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.adk.tools.agent_tool import AgentTool

mas_coordinator = LlmAgent(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-001",
    name="mas_coordinator",
    instruction=coordinator_prompt,
    tools=[AgentTool(agent=sub_agent) for sub_agent in sub_agents]
)
```

### Sub-Agent Pattern

Each sub-agent follows this pattern:

```python
from google.adk import Agent
from google.adk.tools import FunctionTool

sub_agent = Agent(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-001",
    name="specialized_agent",
    description="Handles specific domain tasks",
    instruction=agent_prompt,
    tools=[FunctionTool(func=tool_function)]
)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Tool Return Types

**Critical**: All tools must return dictionaries when used with `AgentTool`:

```python
def tool_function(param1: str, param2: int) -> dict:
    # Process the request
    result = perform_operation(param1, param2)
    
    # Always return a dictionary
    return {
        "status": "success",
        "data": result,
        "metadata": {"param1": param1, "param2": param2}
    }
```

### 2. Prompt Engineering

Coordinator prompts should clearly define routing rules:

```
You are a coordinator that routes requests to specialized agents:
- For weather queries, use weather_agent
- For document queries, use rag_agent
- For greetings, use greeter_agent
```

### 3. Error Handling

Implement robust error handling at both coordinator and sub-agent levels:

```python
try:
    result = process_request(data)
    return {"status": "success", "data": result}
except Exception as e:
    return {"status": "error", "message": str(e)}
```

## Common Patterns

### 1. Contextual Routing

The coordinator can use context to make routing decisions:

```python
if "weather" in query.lower():
    return use_weather_agent()
elif "document" in query.lower() or "search" in query.lower():
    return use_rag_agent()
```

### 2. Multi-Agent Workflows

Some requests may require multiple agents:

```python
# First get data from one agent
data = await data_agent.process(query)

# Then analyze with another agent
analysis = await analysis_agent.process(data)

# Return combined results
return {"data": data, "analysis": analysis}
```

## Deployment Considerations

### 1. Resource Management

- Each agent consumes compute resources
- Consider agent lifecycle management
- Implement caching where appropriate

### 2. Scalability

- Agents can be deployed independently
- Use load balancing for high-traffic agents
- Consider async processing for long-running tasks

### 3. Monitoring

Essential metrics to track:
- Request routing accuracy
- Agent response times
- Error rates by agent
- User satisfaction metrics

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

1. **Agent responses not surfacing**: Ensure tools return dictionaries
2. **Routing failures**: Check coordinator prompt clarity
3. **Performance issues**: Review agent initialization overhead

### Debugging Tips

1. Enable verbose logging in development
2. Test agents independently before integration
3. Use structured logging for better traceability

## Advanced Topics

### 1. Dynamic Agent Registration

Agents can be registered dynamically:

```python
def register_agent(coordinator, new_agent):
    coordinator.tools.append(AgentTool(agent=new_agent))
```

### 2. Agent Specialization

Create highly specialized agents for better performance:
- Domain-specific language models
- Custom tool sets per agent
- Specialized prompts and instructions

### 3. State Management

Implement state sharing between agents:
- Use ToolContext for session state
- Implement persistent storage for long-term state
- Consider distributed state management

## Conclusion

The Multi-Agent System architecture provides a flexible and scalable approach to building complex AI applications. By following the patterns and best practices outlined in this guide, you can create robust multi-agent systems that effectively handle diverse user needs.
