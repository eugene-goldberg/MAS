Abstract:
The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.

Key Contributions:
1. Introduced the Transformer architecture based solely on attention mechanisms
2. Eliminated the need for recurrence and convolutions in sequence transduction
3. Achieved state-of-the-art results on machine translation benchmarks
4. Demonstrated superior parallelizability and training efficiency
5. Showed generalization to other NLP tasks beyond translation

This paper revolutionized natural language processing and became the foundation for models like BERT, GPT, and subsequent large language models. The Transformer architecture introduced several key innovations:

Multi-Head Attention: The model uses multiple attention heads to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. This allows the model to capture various types of relationships in the data.

Positional Encoding: Since the architecture contains no recurrence or convolution, positional encodings are added to give the model information about the relative or absolute position of tokens in the sequence.

Layer Normalization: Applied to stabilize the learning process and improve convergence speed.

Feed-Forward Networks: Position-wise fully connected feed-forward networks are applied to each position separately and identically.

The impact of this work extends far beyond machine translation. The Transformer architecture has become the foundation for:
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series
- T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
- Many other state-of-the-art NLP models

Future research directions stemming from this work include:
- Scaling transformers to handle longer sequences efficiently
- Reducing computational complexity while maintaining performance
- Applying transformer architectures to other domains like computer vision
- Developing more efficient attention mechanisms
- Creating multimodal transformers that can process different types of data
