## Known Issues

### RAG Tool Context Requirements
The failing RAG tools (`add_data`, `rag_query`, `get_corpus_info`) require a properly initialized ToolContext with state management. When `tool_context=None`, these tools fail because they rely on:
- `tool_context.state` for tracking current corpus
- Session state management

**Note**: These tools work correctly when called through the RAG agent, which provides the proper context.

## Conclusions

1. **Core Functionality Verified**: All agents exist and are properly configured
2. **Weather Tools**: Fully functional with real weather API
3. **Academic Tools**: Fully functional with PDF parsing
4. **RAG Tools**: Functional when used through the agent (which provides context)
5. **Coordinator**: All sub-agents are accessible

## Recommendations

For production use:
1. Always use RAG tools through the RAG agent, not directly
2. Weather and Academic tools can be used independently
3. All agents are properly integrated in the MAS coordinator
