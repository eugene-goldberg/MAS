# Academic Research Agents - Summary and Findings

## Overview

The two academic research agents (`academic_websearch_agent` and `academic_newresearch_agent`) have **partial functionality** due to their specialized design requiring specific inputs.

## Key Findings

### 1. **RAG is NOT the appropriate solution**
- These agents need **structured text inputs**, not document search
- They work through **prompt template substitution** with placeholders like `{seminal_paper}`
- RAG is for semantic search; these agents need complete, formatted information

### 2. **Input Requirements**

#### academic_websearch_agent:
- Needs: Formatted seminal paper information (title, authors, year)
- Uses: Google Search tool to find citing papers
- Output: List of recent papers citing the seminal work

#### academic_newresearch_agent:
- Needs: Both seminal paper info AND list of recent citing papers
- Uses: Pure LLM reasoning (no tools)
- Output: Suggested future research directions

### 3. **Current Limitations**
- No PDF parsing capability in MAS
- Agents expect pre-formatted text strings
- Designed for a specific sequential workflow
- Cannot handle general academic queries

## Solution Implemented

Created `academic_tools.py` with helper functions:
- `format_paper_for_websearch()`: Formats paper info for citation search
- `format_research_context()`: Prepares context for research suggestions
- `get_example_paper()`: Provides example seminal papers for testing
- `extract_paper_info_simple()`: Basic text extraction (placeholder for PDF parsing)

## How to Make Fully Functional

### Option 1: Add PDF Parsing (Recommended)
```python
# Add a tool to extract paper info from PDFs
def extract_from_pdf(pdf_path: str) -> dict:
    # Use PyPDF2 or similar to extract:
    # - Title, Authors, Year, Abstract
    # - References section
    # Return formatted text
```

### Option 2: Use Pre-formatted Input
Users provide paper information in a structured format:
```
Title: Attention Is All You Need
Authors: Vaswani et al.
Year: 2017
Abstract: [abstract text]
```

### Option 3: Integrate with External Services
- Use Google Scholar API for paper metadata
- Use CrossRef API for citation information
- Use arXiv API for paper details

## Testing Results

1. **Without proper inputs**: Agents cannot function
2. **With formatted inputs**: Agents can be configured but need deployment
3. **Through MAS coordinator**: Currently explains limitations to users

## Recommendations

1. **Short term**: Document the workflow and provide examples
2. **Medium term**: Add PDF parsing capability
3. **Long term**: Create a dedicated academic research coordinator that handles the multi-step workflow

## Example Usage (When Fully Functional)

```python
# Step 1: User provides paper
paper_info = extract_from_pdf("transformers.pdf")

# Step 2: Find citations
citations = academic_websearch_agent.run(
    seminal_paper=paper_info
)

# Step 3: Generate research directions
directions = academic_newresearch_agent.run(
    seminal_paper=paper_info,
    recent_citing_papers=citations
)
```

## Conclusion

The academic agents are well-designed for their specific use case but need additional infrastructure (PDF parsing, workflow management) to be fully functional in the MAS system. They are not broken, just incomplete without the proper input preparation layer.
