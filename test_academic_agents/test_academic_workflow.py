Title: Attention Is All You Need
Primary Authors: Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, ≈Åukasz Kaiser, Illia Polosukhin
Publication Year: 2017
DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762

Abstract: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train.

Key Contributions:
1. Introduced the Transformer architecture based solely on attention mechanisms
2. Developed multi-head self-attention mechanism
3. Eliminated need for recurrence and convolutions in sequence models
4. Achieved state-of-the-art results on machine translation benchmarks
5. Demonstrated significant training time reduction through parallelization
